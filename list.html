          KH2FMHD is about the protagonist, Roxas, and exclusively, only, Roxas, going about the day seven days of his summer vacation.<br>
          The reason why it's on this list is because of how good the Final Mix-exclusive Critical Mode is. <a href="whykh2fmisgreat.txt">I explain my reasoning behind this over here, far too long to put in this page.</a><br>
          KH2FMHD can only be played if you own a PS3 (KHII.5 HD ReMIX) or a PS4, (KHI.5+II.5 HD ReMIX) although I significantly recommend playing on a PS4 over a PS3 due to bugs and slowdowns that can unfairly turn fights against you if you aren't aware of ways to counteract them.<br>
          The disc versions of both can be found for fairly low prices, I don't recommend buying it at full price digitally.<br>
          While I like Kingdom Hearts a lot, you don't need to play the first two games in order to get a good enough grasp of what's going on.

          Of course, Mother 3 has never been released outside of Japan to this day, limiting the only way to play it for non-Japanese people to patching a ROM, gotten from dumping an overpriced GBA cart where the developers get a 0% cut, or downloading a ROM where the developers get a 0% cut.<br/>

          The game is mostly puzzles in the form of fetch quests, with some cool 'meta puzzles' sparsed inbetween. It's good, but the story is flawed, retrospectively. I like it, though.

          The Balance Arc of the show is the first part of the show, about mercenaries Magnus, Taako and Merle going on adventures cooked up by 30 Under 30 Media Luminary Griffin McElroy.<br>
          The Adventure Zone was initially a one-time special episode of MBMBaM, a different podcast by 3/4 of the McElroys, before it became it's own podcast. Because of this, the initial episodes are of significantly lower quality than later quests of the show, with it getting progressively better over time, to the point Griffin McElroy began producing his own music for the show during and after the third quest. It's a long show, (80 hours long!) but is absolutely worth the investment.<br>
          The Adventure Zone is available in two main ways; <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6OoAQesdLgYBOyfx8ji0bZ">you can stream the episodes on Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">you can download the episodes directly from MaximumFun.</a><br>

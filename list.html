          Try to play blind; I might write a spoiler-free guide for collecting the effects at some point <b>(EDIT: Past me is a liar)</b>,  but it's still best to try to do it yourself.<br/>

          KH2FMHD is about the protagonist, Roxas, and exclusively, only, Roxas, going about the day seven days of his summer vacation.<br>
          The reason why it's on this list is because of how good the Final Mix-exclusive Critical Mode is. <a href="whykh2fmisgreat.txt">I explain my reasoning behind this over here, far too long to put in this page.</a><br>
          KH2FMHD can only be played if you own a PS3 (KHII.5 HD ReMIX) or a PS4, (KHI.5+II.5 HD ReMIX) although I significantly recommend playing on a PS4 over a PS3 due to bugs and slowdowns that can unfairly turn fights against you if you aren't aware of ways to counteract them.<br>
          The disc versions of both can be found for fairly low prices, I don't recommend buying it at full price digitally.<br>
          While I like Kingdom Hearts a lot, you don't need to play the first two games in order to get a good enough grasp of what's going on.

          It's an absolutely fantastic game, with an incredible OST by A Shell in the Pit, that fits alongside the emotional experience that is Wandersong perfectly. Please, play Wandersong. It's worth your time.<br>
          Wandersong can be played on either PC or Nintendo Switch, but if you choose to play on PC, <a href="images/banovonperformance.png">be aware of issues with performance on lower performance PCs.</a>

          Cave Story is about a scrappy amnesiac waking up in a cave, finding a gun, and saving a race of rabbit people, with the extension of shooting a lot of things. It's really good.<br>

          Of course, Mother 3 has never been released outside of Japan to this day, limiting the only way to play it for non-Japanese people to patching a ROM, gotten from dumping an overpriced GBA cart where the developers get a 0% cut, or downloading a ROM where the developers get a 0% cut.<br/>

          Beglitched is about you discovering the mysterious Glitch Witch's (manipulates the fabric of the modern world to her will. kind of a big deal) laptop, and running her errands.<br>
          Fun fact: I am (as of writing this) one of only 3824 people who <i>own</i> this game. That's not even accounting for how many have even finished it.<br>
          As such, there are no guides. Anywhere. Just you and Beglitched's cyberpink minesweeping. <a href="images/beglitched.png">Have fun!</a><br>
          <b>EDIT: While I greatly enjoyed my time with Beglitched, there's a specific segment of the game that is infuriatingly dependent on your RNG. I got lucky, chances are, you won't. There's great stuff in Beglitched, but know this before going into it.</b>

          The Balance Arc of the show is the first part of the show, about mercenaries Magnus, Taako and Merle going on adventures cooked up by 30 Under 30 Media Luminary Griffin McElroy.<br>
          The Adventure Zone was initially a one-time special episode of MBMBaM, a different podcast by 3/4 of the McElroys, before it became it's own podcast. Because of this, the initial episodes are of significantly lower quality than later quests of the show, with it getting progressively better over time, to the point Griffin McElroy began producing his own music for the show during and after the third quest. It's a long show, (80 hours long!) but is absolutely worth the investment.<br>
          The Adventure Zone is available in two main ways; <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6OoAQesdLgYBOyfx8ji0bZ">you can stream the episodes on Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone">you can download the episodes directly from MaximumFun.</a><br>
          There's also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cj8d6EcFp0">an incredible official trailer for it</a>, if you aren't sold. It does show off some story beats out of context, so if you want to go in fully blind you might not want to watch it.<br>
          If focusing on podcasts is an issue for you, (like it was for me) the <a href="http://tazscripts.tumblr.com/tazscripts">incredible TAZScripts fanproject transcribes all the TAZ episodes as they come out!</a> This was a very helpful tool for me as I was going through episodes, although there are a few small hiccups in the transcript from time to time.

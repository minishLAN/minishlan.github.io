          Try to play blind; I might write a spoiler-free guide for collecting the effects at some point, but it's still best to try to do it yourself.<br/>

          A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe is about Everyman and his growing entourage of allies treking through the endless white void that surrounds them to find answers and/or a way to survive.<br />
          There's also a sequel (<a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=334">Chairman Jack: Emerge</a>) but it's pretty confusing, the images are dead, and it has also been on indefinite hiatus since <i>March 2012</i>.

          Beglitched is about you discovering the mysterious Glitch Witch's (manipulates the fabric of the modern world to her will. kind of a big deal) laptop, and running her errands.<br />
          Fun fact: I am (as of writing this) one of only 2889 people who <i>own</i> this game. That's not even accounting for how many have even finished it.<br />
          As such, there are no guides. Anywhere. Just you and Beglitched's cyberpink minesweeping. <a href="images/beglitched.png">Have fun!</a>

          Cave Story is about a scrappy amnesiac waking up in a cave, finding a gun, and saving a race of rabbit people, with the extension of shooting a lot of things. It's really good.<br />
          The path for the true ending is stupidly complicated; backup a save from the beginning of Labyrinth (if you can), and read <a href="csbestending.txt">this guide</a> after you've gotten the normal ending. <b>(DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T)</b><br />
          Also, Cave Story has a metric fuckton of ports, in addition to <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php">the original (free) version.</a><br />

          OneShot is about guiding young Niko through a decaying world. The world knows you exist. You only have one shot - wait actually you have two.<br />
          The game is mostly puzzles in the form of fetch quests, with some cool 'meta puzzles' sparsed inbetween. It's good, but the story is flawed, retrospectively. I like it, though.
